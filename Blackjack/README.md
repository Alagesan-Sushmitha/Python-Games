# Blackjack Game
* This is a command-line based implementation of the popular casino card game Blackjack, developed in Python. 
* The game follows standard Blackjack rules, where the player competes against the dealer to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

## How to Play
* Run the blackjack.py file in a Python environment.
* The player, including the dealer, will receive two initial cards, face-up.
* The players can choose to "Hit" (receive another card) or "Stand" (stop receiving cards) to reach a favorable hand value.
* If a player's hand exceeds 21, they go "Bust" and lose the round.
* Once the player has completed the turn, the dealer reveals their second card and draws additional cards according to predefined rules.
* The dealer will continue drawing until their hand value reaches at least 17.
* The round concludes, and the player with the hand closest to 21 without exceeding it wins.
* Play again by running the blackjack.py file.

### Game Features
* Multiple players can participate in the game, competing against the dealer.
* Player actions are implemented, allowing them to hit or stand during their turn.
* The game enforces Blackjack rules, including bust conditions and dealer drawing rules.
* Console output provides a clear representation of the game state and results.
* Enjoy playing Blackjack in this Python implementation! Test your luck and skill in pursuit of the perfect hand. Good luck!
